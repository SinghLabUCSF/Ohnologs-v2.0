##  Orthologs with Amphioxus

1. Downloaded amphioxus data from: http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Brafl1/Brafl1.download.ftp.html

2. Downloaded all protein fasta files from Ensembl v84.

3. Get longest protein coding transcript for each gene.

4. Make blast databases and run BLASTp from vertebrates to outgroups and select the top hit as ortholog.
